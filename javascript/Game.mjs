         The algorithm is based on Breadth-first search algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) except that the creation and the searching happens at the same time to prevent generating the entire tree.
         
         Each node of the tree are define as follow :
         node = {
             elements -> An array containing the cards that the algorithm can use to generated sub-result in order to get close to the solution.
             equations -> An array containing the equations that has already been made in order to have sub-result and to get close to the solution.
         }
 
         A queue is initialize with a first node containing all the cards that can be used to find a solution, and an empty array of equations
 
         The algorithm loop until the queue is empty or until a solution is found.
         The exploration of a node consist of taking all element and using the different operations at hands to generate other nodes, these new nodes are added at the end of the queue.
         If during this process, the exploration gives the number to find, then the current node is returned and no other nodes are being explored.
 
         If no node give the number to find then the best node is return. The best node is the one that has a value in node.element that is the closest to the number to find.
 
         Sidenotes : 
             1. An idea was that we append a generated node to the beginning of the queue instead of the end if this node was 'closer' to the solution than any other node already present in the queue.
                Problem -> the algoritm made useless operation before giving the solution because one of its sub-result was closer, thus was explored sooner.
                e.g.
                Find 49 with 6, 6, 7, 7, 10, 2.
                The obvious solution would be to do 7 x 7 = 49. But the algorithm returned [6 x 6 = 36, 7 x 7 = 49] because it made 6 x 6 first, obtained 36, which was closer to 49 than 7, thus exploring this node first.
                (This e.g. is based on a case that happened but did not used those numbers exactly, it is just to get the idea).
